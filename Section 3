+++Problem 1: Why is there a lot of hype around blockchain+++ 
--> The buzz word blockchain came into hype in last few years , 
some of the main reasons that's what i think :

I will explian first what is blockchain : 
A blockchain is a transaction ledger that is:

Open: Anyone can access it, anyone can work on it, and anyone can participate. Irrespective of who they are

Borderless: There are no countries, the network does not see the borders between nations.

Neutral: The network does not care who you are. It does not serve the goals of any organization. 
Every transaction is equal in the eyes of the blockchain network.4

Decentralized. The blockchain ledger is not stored on a single central computer. 
There is no central authority controlling everything..

No Third Party. No big brother approving your transaction, no middleman.

Censorship resistant: Once a transaction is made into the system it cannot be revered.

so with this Transactions are becoming more global. Lot of people are thinking about ways to reduce the conversion rates.
Distributed data storage and consistency-handling evolved to a stage where we can efficiently store and maintain ledgers.
Blockchain also provides possibilities of building in modes of payment (intelligent contracts) into financial transactions. 
Adding to that funding initiatives through bitcoins or ethers is creating a very positive energy around innovation in the space.
